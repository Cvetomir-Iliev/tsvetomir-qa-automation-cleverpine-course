# Lecture 4 Homework: Advanced Arrays

## How to run

From the repository root:

- Run the integration dashboard:

```
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/advanced-analytics-dashboard.js
```

- You can also run each task file individually to see the small demos:

```
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/task01/map-transformations.js
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/task02/filter-views.js
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/task03/reduce-metrics.js
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/task04/sort-reports.js
node lectures/04-advanced-arrays/homework/task05/destructuring-utils.js
```

All files use only concepts covered in Lectures 1â€“4 (arrays, map/filter/reduce/sort, destructuring, conditionals, loops, template strings/concatenation).
